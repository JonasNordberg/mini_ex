A title of your program
### Did you get the Memo?

### What is the program about? which API have you used and why?
The program is called, “Did you get the memo?” It is about finding the trending memes from giphy.com since you want to be up on the beat. The internet culture of memes move so fast that you always need to be updated to the latest and greatest. 
Gifs has become some sort of computer language since the APIs has become available to the biggest chat forums. You no longer have to write a message you can just type in your feelings and find a gif that expresses what you want. At the same time people get to reference popular tv-shows, movies or even memes.
A gif is also a great way to show humour, and that you are up on the beat. And by being up on the beat you can become a trendsetter and ultimately be popular among your friends.
So this program is really just a way to make it easier to see what is popular right now. We’ve made margins to make it easy to get an overview. With this program we hope that you want to add the page to your bookmarks, so that you are always close to be updated, without having to go directly to giphy and bother with advertisements and a non-intuitive webpage. 


(individual)Can you describe and reflect your process of making this mini exercise in terms of acquiring, processing, using and representing data? How much do you understand this provided data? How do platform providers sort the data and give you the selected data?

When I first heard about APIs i never thought that companies gave this much data "for free" to their users. When we first started using the Google API, I quickly found out that you could basically create a Google search enginge yourself within a short period of time, and that really surprised me. Another thing is that they are really good at providing information to their users on how to sort and select specific results from their page. Of course I don't understand all the information that they give me, but I really do believe that if I had more time to search for the APIs I would be able to make something even more integrated and use some harder syntaxes aswell. 

(individual)Try to formulate a question in relation to web APIs or querying processes that you want to investigate further when you have more time.

If I had more time I would probably look more into the Instagram API. It is a platform that I use a lot myself, so to get acess to the API is also a way for me to understand the platform even better.
