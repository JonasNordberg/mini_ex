Tasks:

Make sure you have read Goriunova's text: Goriunova, Oga. Fun and Software: Exploring Pleasure, Paradox and Pain in Computing. Bloomsbury Academic, 2014, pp.1-19.(see weekly ref list)
Design a program that expresses and addresses Goriunova's notion of fun by using basic shapes primarily. (it is ok to be simple, and it is ok to draw something static. Perhaps you can try to implement from scratch by thinking about what you want and what you want to show/tell)
Upload your program/result to your own Github account under a folder called mini_ex2. (Make sure your program can be run on a web browser)
Create a readme file (README.md) and upload to the same mini_ex2 directory (see this for editing the README). The readme file should contain the followings:
A screenshot of your program
A URL link to your program and run on a browser, see: https://rawgit.com/
Describe your program and what you have used and learnt
What is fun? To what extend your program addresses Goriunova's noton of fun? Is it fun in relation to geekiness, or humour, or paradox, or other modes of thoughts? (This question requires your articulation of your work beyond just describing how it works technically)
Provide peer-feedback to 2 of your classmates on their works by creating "issues" on his/her github corresponding repository. Write with the issue title "Feedback on mini_ex(?) by (YOUR FULL NAME)"
