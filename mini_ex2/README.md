With this program I have tried to put in my thoughts of fun. What is fun to me? 

When I asked myself this question I had a lot of answers. First of all my notion of fun doesn't have to be humour. It can be the small and simple things to me.





Dancing is fun, and Saturday Night Fever is fun. So why not create a program to honor John Travolta and his dance moves? 
Turn up the volume and enjoy a dancing square, or a dancefloor - it's up to you.
