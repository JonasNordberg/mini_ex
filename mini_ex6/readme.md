A generative program

When thinking of generativity in terms of programming, there are really no limits. It is just you and the computer having some sort of a dialoque.
You give some commands and then the computer answers back with either an error message or a running program. And when you then think of generativity, the computer answers back with something, that you as a programmer might haven't seen coming.
And that is when it begins to be fun.

You can talk about generativity for a long time. Questions popping up all the time like: Who made the program, you or the computer? 
To this question you can really argue for both sides. The program itself can be more complex than the human mind can manage to comprehend, and then it is the computer
brain which takes over and visually shows the programmer the result of the inserted coding. But the computer can't really do anything by itself before getting the code, which is made by a human.
So if I would have to take a side in this argument I would probably say that the creator is the human, but the product is a result of a dialoque between human and computer. 


I have made a program too, which is based on this idea of generativity.
First of I had hundreds of ideas in which I could create something in Atom. Firstly I made a Stephen Hawking tribute:

But the program never really seemed to work properly, so I went back in time and found something I've made some time ago using sound library

The program itself consists of different rules and statements. Firstly it runs by the p5.Amplifier thingy which means that the sound coming from the program
does things in relation to the sound. 
Then I made it with the volHistory thing, so that the previous sound level would be remembered and a shape would be drawn. This shape began to look like a skyline so I immediately thought of New York New York by Frank Sinatra.

So here it is:
